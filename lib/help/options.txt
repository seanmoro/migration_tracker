NAME
       migration_tracker - Manage and monitor Spectra Logic data migrations with tracking and forecasting

SYNOPSIS
       Linux:
           migration_tracker [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

       Windows:
           migration_tracker.bat [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Migration Tracker is a script to simplify the management and monitoring of Spectra Logic data migrations.
       It tracks the number of objects being migrated and reports statistics on each phase of the migration, 
       providing valuable information for forecasting.

       Migration Tracker projects are created in the following order:

           1.) Create the customer
           2.) Create the project
           3.) Create the phase

       When creating a project (especially a phase), the customer's database must be loaded so reference data can be 
       gathered. Each phaseould be defined up front. For example, if migrating five buckets, each bucket (phase) 
      ould be pre-configured to allow global forecasts based on partial data.

       At the start of each phase, upload a fr database and run the `gather-data` command with the date from the 
       database file name. This will serve as a baseline to improve forecasting accuracy.

       If multiple data points exist for a migration, `gather-data` will generate:
         • A report since the last data point
         • A report covering the entire phase

COMMANDS
       create-customer
              Create a new customer for a project.
              Requires: --name

       create-project
              Create a new project for a customer.
              Requires: --project, --company, --type [IOM_BUCKET | IOM_EXCLUSION | RIO_CRUISE_DIVA | RIO_CRUISE_SGL | RIO_CRUISE_OTHER]

       create-phase
              Create a new phase of a project.
              Requires: --phase,
                        --project,
                        --type [IOM_BUCKET | IOM_EXCLUSION | RIO_CRUISE], 
                        --source [{storage_domain_name} | {broker_name}], 
                        --target [{storage_domain_name} | {broker_name}]

              Notes:
                - In RIO_CRUISE, the phase name does not matter.
                - In IOM_BUCKET, the phase must begin with the bucket name (case-sensitive).
                - For multi-copy IOM_BUCKETs, track each as a separate phase (e.g. "my-bucket: second copy").
                - Use --tape-partition to track tape usage; requires a BlackPearl DB even for RIO_CRUISE.

       gather-data
              Gather migration stats from a provided database and generate reports.
              Requires: --project, --phase, --date
              Notes:
                - For IOM multi-copy projects, using just the bucket name will aggregate across all sub-phases.

       list-buckets
              List all buckets in the loaded BlackPearl database.

       list-customers
              List all customers currently configured.

       list-projects
              List all configured projects.

       list-project-phases
              List phases for a project.
              Requires: --project

       report-progress-latest
              Generate a report for the most recent migration data.
              Requires: --project, --phase

       report-progress-phase
              Generate a full-to-date report for a migration phase.
              Requires: --project, --phase

       search-customers
              Search customers by partial name match.
              Requires: --name

       search-projects
              Search projects by partial name match.
              Requires: --project

       search-project-phases
              Search project phases by partial phase name.
              Requires: --project, --phase

       unpack-database
              Unpack a database and prep it for analysis.
              Requires: --file [path/to/backup], --type [blackpearl | rio]

EXAMPLES
       Create a new customer:

           migration_tracker create-customer --name BigDataCo

       Create a new project for IOM_BUCKET migration:

           migration_tracker create-project --project DeepDive --company BigDataCo --type IOM_BUCKET

       Create a phase with tape partition tracking:

           migration_tracker create-phase --project DeepDive --phase logs-archive --type IOM_BUCKET \
               --source hot-storage --target tape-vault --tape-partition TAPE-01

       Gather data from a new DB file dated 2024-10-05:

           migration_tracker gather-data --project DeepDive --phase logs-archive --date 2024-10-05

       Generate a report for a phase:

           migration_tracker report-progress-phase --project DeepDive --phase logs-archive

       Search customers with name containing “data”:

           migration_tracker search-customers --name data
